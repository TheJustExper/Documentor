                                Laughton-en-le-Morthen Parish Council was formed in 1994 after a decision was taken by
                                the
                                Boundaries Commission as a result of a public consultation process started in 1986, when
                                parishioners requested the formation of their own parish. Meetings are held on the 2nd
                                Wednesday
                                of every month (except August) and take place from 7pm in the Village Hall located on
                                Firbeck
                                Avenue, Laughton-en-le-Morthen. Documents relating to previous meetings can be found in
                                the
                                ‘Meetings &amp; Minutes’ section of the website.
                                The Parish Council is the first tier of government, though Laughton-en-le-Morthen Parish
                                Council is
                                not aligned to anypolitical party. All our meetings are open to parishioners who are
                                welcome to
                                attend; an agenda for the forthcoming meeting can be requested by contacting the Clerk
                                to the
                                Council.
                                Our elected members work on a voluntary basis and do not claim any expenses relating to

                                as councillors. In brief, the Parish Council discusses, governs and sets policies
                                relating to the
                                following areas, many of which are detailed further throughout the website:

                            <h1>History</h1>
                            <p>What&#39;s in a name?
                                The origin of the village&#39;s name has several theories. In the Doomsday Book the
                                village name is
                                &#39;Lastone&#39;, yet the Saxon name was &#39;Law town&#39;. The word &#39;Morthen&#39;
                                derives from the old norse term
                                &#39;Morthing&#39; meaning &#39;a moorland district with a common assembly&#39;. An
                                alternative theory comes
                                from the old French &#39;en le Morthen&#39; word for &#39;place of death&#39; . This
                                theory is based on information
                                that the area around Laughton-en-le-Morthen was part of the site od the Battle of
                                Brunanburh
                                around 937AD. This is commemorated in Celtic legend as the last chance to rgain the
                                mainland from
                                the Saxons. In truth it was more a case of the various Celtic and Viking chieftains and
                                lords (this was
                                part of Yorvik) versus resurgent Saxon power. Approximately 50,000 warriors are reputed
                                to have
                                died in the most decisive battle for the control of the future history of the British
                                Isles. If so, it is a
                                well-deserved name as the death toll was comparable to Britain&#39;s entire World War II
                                death toll as a
                                proportion of the population. In contrast, it is also recorded that the village was
                                commonly known by the name of ‘Lighten in the
                                Morning’ - looking eastward to the village, the lofty spire was clearly defined in the
                                early light of the
                                morning.
                                From 1066 to 1379
                                Before 1066, Laughton belonged to Earl Edwin who had a hall there. Held by Roger de
                                Busli in 1086,
                                Laughton was the head of a large soke within the honour of Tickhill and was a thriving
                                village. Roger
                                de Busli had 5 plough teams of his own and the population of 33 villeins and 6 small
                                holders had ten
                                plough teams between them. Eventually the de Busli honour of Tickhill passed to King
                                Henry I who
                                gave the church of Laughton to the Canon of York. Until the 13th century, The Manor of
                                Laughton remained in the hands of the crown. The manor was
                                then given to Geoffrey de Lusignan by Prince Edward, son of Henry III. Drogo de Merlawe
                                was Lord
                                of the Manor in the reign of Edward II. In 1332 the lordship had passed to the Frenchman
                                Ralph, Earl
                                of Eu. In 1332 Vicar of Laughton, James de Brampton, was fined for beating Hugh de
                                Lindesay, one of
                                the Earl of Eu servants. The estates of the Earl were seized at the outbreak of the 100
                                Year War and
                                returned into the hands of the crown. Together with the Honour of Tickhill it was passed
                                to the
                                King&#39;s son, John of Gaunt. When his son ascended the throne as Henry the IV,
                                Laughton once again
                                passed into the hands of the crown.</p>

                                        en-le-Morthen
                                        The allotment site at St John’s Road, Laughton-en-le-Morthen has been leased from
                                        the St Leger Estate by the Parish Council for over 100 years. The area provides a
                                        total of 97 plots which are available to rent by anyone living within 5 miles of the
                                        parish. The allotments are provided for the cultivation of produce for the benefit of
                                        the allotment holder and his/her immediate family. Allotments are not provided for
                                        the purpose of any trade or business for financial gain.
                                         
                                        The Parish Council oversee the letting of plots and administrative duties involved in
                                        leasing the site, though the day-to-day running is carried out by a voluntary
                                        committee, the St John’s Road Allotment Society, made up of existing tenants. All
                                        tenants are required to pay a subscription to the National Society of Allotment &amp;
                                        Leisure Gardeners, in addition to their annual rent charge. The rent for an individual
                                        plot is set annually and includes access to the water supply. Please contact the Clerk
                                        for information on the current annual charge.
                                         
                                        The St John’s Road Allotment Society operate a well-stocked shop on the site which
                                        sells vegetable seeds, bird feed, compost, fertiliser and other gardening-related
                                        products. It is currently open every Saturday between 11am – 12noon. Non-tenants
                                        who wish to purchase items from the site can do so by joining the society for a
                                        nominal annual fee. Details can be obtained from the allotment shop.
                                         
                                        Since the St John’s Road Allotment Society was formed in 2010, a number of joint
                                        projects with the Parish Council have been carried out to improve the site. This
                                        includes:
                                         
                                        • The removal of asbestos from the site.
                                        • Upgrades to the on-site security including new locks and additional barriers.
                                        • Assistance in the removal of rubbish from many of the plots.
                                        • The creation of a communal garden area (on-going).
                                        • Regular hedge-trimming to improve the entrance road.
                                        • Purchase of road-scalpings to fill potholes on the allotment track.
